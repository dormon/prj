State has some transitions to other states
Transition can be based on single value or range
There can also be special transition - else transition - that is applied if every other transition cannot be applied
Else Transition always takes 1 byte of data.
Lenght of transition values can vary.
Range is described using two values with same length.
There has to be tree of transitions values in order to find correct transition quickly.

How to build the tree:
Every path from any node to leaf nodes has have same length.
